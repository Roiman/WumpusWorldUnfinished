# WumpusWorldUnfinished
An unfinished implementation of the Wumpus World problem in Russel and Norvig 2003.
The code does not actually support an AI at the moment nor does it do a search, due to complications during its writing.
I had to stop devloping it because of a deadline, but there are many other functioning versions out there.
